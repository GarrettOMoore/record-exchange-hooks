I decided to refactor a very old app of mine to use React, not only because I've been living in Reactland for a while now - but also because I thought the data flow / UI I wanted lent itself extremely well to React. Given that the core of the app involves a series of large API calls that I can then filter through various components, I also thought of it as a great candidate to finally try using the React Hooks API! It's still a work in progress, but has been a really fun project to work on.
